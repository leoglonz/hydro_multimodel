Steps to run HBV 1.0 with PMI;

*It is easiest to work on Suntzu, as the config is already set to source
the CAMELS data from there.


To begin training (or testing, if you have a trained model) note the following:

1. Edit your configuration file: `dPLHydro_multimodel/conf/config.yaml`
    - Specify the `gpu_id` of the GPU to use (default 0)
    - Set `data_dir` as the path to the folder where trained models and other
      support files should be saved.

    This will give configurations to run HBV 1.0 with 2 dynamic parameters.

2. Create a conda env with `mulhydrodl_env.yaml` and activate. (The hydrodl env
   should also work since dependancies are similar.)

3. While in the `hydro_multimodel/dPLHydro_multimodel` directory start the training
   with `python __main__.py


To perform model training, `mode` in the configuration file should be set to `test`.
Alternatively, training and testing can be done in the same instance with `train_test`.
