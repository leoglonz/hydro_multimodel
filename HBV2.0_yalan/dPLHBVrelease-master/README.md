# differentiable parameter learning (dPL) + HBV hydrologic model
### Code release created by Dapeng Feng
This release contains the codes to train models with differentiable parameter learning (dPL) applied to HBV backbone 
as shown in these papers below. If any of the codes is useful for your research, please cite these papers.

## Instructions
The original full code release was made in this Zenodo link (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7091334). Please check this link out
because it contains the necessary Potential Evapotranspiration data for reproducing the paper results. This Zenodo release 
also includes other detailed information related to running the codes. We presently use this GitHub repository to update our code release. 

Please read this [Instruction PDF File](Instructions_README.pdf) which includes detailed instructions for running the 
released codes, training and testing dPL+HBV models. Please also check out this Bug Fix File (https://bit.ly/3TOKmqK) where
we log bug fixing information in historical versions of this release and answers to some frequently asked questions.


If you have any questions for this code release, feel free to contact us by duf328@psu.edu (Dapeng Feng) or cshen@engr.psu.edu (Chaopeng Shen)
